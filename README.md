# traffic-routes-qc
A program that creates QUBO instances of a problem wherein cars are assigned optimal routes on a map to reach their destinations so as to minimize traffic congestion. Recreates and improves the work carried out by researchers at D-Wave Systems and Data:Lab Munich. Their research paper which inspired this program can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01625

Our program functions on multiple maps and with any number of vehicles and routes considered per vehicle.

To run the program: run GUI.py
